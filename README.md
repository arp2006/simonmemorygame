## Overview
This project is a simple interactive game where users can click buttons to make selections based on color. The game generates a sequence of colors that players must follow.

## Features
- Color sequence generation
- User interaction with buttons
- Sound effects for button presses
- High score tracking

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage
- Press the buttons as instructed by the game to match the color sequence.
- Your current score will be displayed.
- The highest score achieved will be saved until you reset the game.

## High Score Feature (soon)
The high score feature keeps track of the highest score during gameplay:
- Upon completing the game, it checks if the current score exceeds the previously saved high score.
- If it does, the high score is updated and displayed.

## Audio Files
Make sure to have the audio files in the `sounds` directory:
- Each sound file should be named according to its corresponding button color (e.g., `red.mp3`, `blue.mp3`, etc.).

## Acknowledgments
Inspired by various interactive game tutorials, this project aims to solidify understanding of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
